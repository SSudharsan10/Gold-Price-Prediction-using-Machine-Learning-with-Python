# Gold-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-with-Python
 This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts gold prices based on historical data. We employ a Random Forest model for accurate forecasting and provide insights into the gold market trends.

Project Overview
Gold, as a commodity, holds significant value and is subject to various market influences. Predicting its price can be a complex yet valuable task. In this project, we aim to:

**Analyze Historical Gold Prices**: We gather and explore historical data from a Kaggle dataset to understand patterns, trends, and correlations.

**Feature Engineering**: We preprocess the data, extract relevant features, and perform exploratory data analysis to uncover insights.

**Building the Random Forest Model**: We employ the Random Forest algorithm, a powerful ensemble learning technique, to predict future gold prices based on the available data.

**Evaluation and Validation**: We assess the model's performance, validate its predictions, and compare them with actual gold prices.
